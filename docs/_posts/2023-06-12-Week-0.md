# Summary

In the first meeting with my tutor, we established the key points of my TFG, developed a roadmap, and set the theoretical base for my work. Please refer to [page](a) for a more detailed explanation of the nature of my TFG. 

# Development

During this week, I studied the mentioned material and prepared the development based on the following ideas:

* This work is closely related to [Unibotics](https://unibotics.org/), as this TFG is done in collaboration with JdeRobot, its developer.
* This TFG will provide a new way to develop robotics applications within the Unibotics ecosystem, based on Behavior Trees, 
* The development of these apps will be web-based, with an editor consisting on **Files** | **Editor** | **Execution**.
* The graphical editor will generate an XML description, that will be transformed into an executable Python code.

I started the development of the first version without abstraction levels in the trees. The goal is to be able to transform XML + Python actions into executable code. For that reason, the main focus of this week was the study of the py_trees library by Daniel Stonier.
