# Summary

In the previous week, I achieved a ROS 2 package with full port and decorator support. This package is called *py_gardener* and allows for tree creation in almost the same way as BT.cpp. 

# Development

## A new approach

Currently, the package can only be used within a ROS 2 workspace. This is useful as it is, but since the main objective of my TFG is to create a Web Frontend for tree creation using the RADI of Robotics Academy, the generation of trees should be ROS-agnostic.

To achieve this, I have begun restructuring the package so the parser is independent from ROS 2 execution. The ultimate goal of the package is to generate a self-contained ROS 2 package that can be executed at a later time."

Of course, *py_gardener* will be stored for later publishing. 

### A new python module

I spent a great part of this learning how to create an independent python package using Hatch, a dependency manager. 

I try diferent modules configurations: initially, all the functionality (parser, translator and tools) were encapsulated into a new python package, *tree_gardener*. 

### New organization

However, I soon realized, as explained above, that the separation which made more sense was:

However, as I soon realized and explained above, the separation that made the most sense is as follows:

- ROS Execution Dependencies: These include the *tree_factory* and the *tree_tools*, which provide the tools necessary for using trees within ROS.

- ROS Package Generation: This comprises the *tree_generator*, which prepares a  self-contained tree with all the user actions, and the *app_generator*, which creates a fully usable ROS 2 package.

This structure aligns better with the usage steps: first comes creation, and then comes execution. first creation and then execution.
